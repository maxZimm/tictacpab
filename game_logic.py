# Questions for this class
# Do you run automatically? Yes if you mean you don't have to instantiate me after sending me to python
# What do you do first? Create a player by askin for a name
# How many players? 2, perhaps just one and I'll play against you intead
# Who goes first? Good question, player1 for now
# What then? I ask player1 what move they would like to make
# How does p1 know whats a available? I show them the board, it'll be empty at this point
# How does p1 tell you there move? Good question, by typing in a format I'll recognize
# Whats the format? Still figuring it out, so it will need to be along the lines of ROW L|M|R (left middle right)
# perhaps TOP|MID|BOT asked first, then L|M|R asked second then the vars saved and combined internally
